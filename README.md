# challenge
This is the repository to save my rock, paper, scissors challenge game.
In this project, I have used the Spring Framework, in particular, the Spring boot tool,
which allow me to create faster the project and aggregate some important dependencies.
All dependencies required are included in the project.
It was used the template engine Thymeleaf to generate the templates that were used in 
the app.
It was used Java 8.
I have recreated a Rest Controller to get the information neccesary to draw the charts of
the second part of the challenge.
I have also used a Google API to draw the charts and the jQuery library to develop some functions.
As spring boot has a Server integrated it is not neccesary to run the app in a external Server.
It is only neccesary to run the app as a Spring Boot App.
I added some improvements to construct better the URLs.
The URL to access the app it's: http://localhost:8080/gamerps/showinit when you download and run the application as Spring Boot App.
